# Introduction

> API Endpoint:

```
https://api.bookwhen.com/v1
```

Welcome to the __Bookwhen Public API__ docs.

Bookwhen is a flexible booking system for recurring events such as classes, courses, and workshops.

The bookwhen public pages use this API so it's feature complete for a complete front-end booking solution. You could use the API to list upcoming events, or to create a full booking javascript widget. Let us know if you do!

# Authentication

> Use HTTP Basic authentication for all requests:

```curl
curl https://api.bookwhen.com/v1/events \
  -u YOURAPIKEY:
```

> Replace `YOURAPIKEY` with your API key and append a colon to prevent it from asking for a password.

Bookwhen uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Bookwhen API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Bookwhen expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: YOURAPIKEY`

<!--aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>YOURAPIKEY</code> with your personal API key.
</aside-->
