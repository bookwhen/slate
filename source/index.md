# Introduction

Welcome to the Bookwhen Public API docs.

Bookwhen is a flexible booking system tailored for multiple events such as classes, courses, and workshops.

Bookwhen uses this API to run the public booking pages, so it's feature complete for a complete front-end booking solution. You could use the API to list upcoming events, or to create a full booking javascript widget. Let us know if you do!

# Authentication

> Use HTTP Basic to authenticate:

```curl
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
